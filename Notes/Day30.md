# Day 30: Project 5, part 2

### Adding to a list of words
* This video we just worked on the UI. 
* We added a TextField that accepts words
  * we learned how to give an onSubmit event to the List so that when any text field is submitted a function will run
* Our function lowercases each word and removes any of the white spaces
  * it also adds a guard that makes sure the word is greater than 1 character
* Oh we also learned about adding withAnimation when you insert a value so that it shows as an animation on the phone
``` swift
withAnimation {
  usedWords.insert(answer, at: 0)
}
```
* To stop the keyboard from auto capitalizing the first word in the text box we added the modifier `textInputAutocapitalization(.never)`
* Oh we also added an SF symbol so that when we display the usedWords a circle with the number of character shows up next to each word. 

### Running code when our app launches
* This video focused on imported our text file with a list of a bunch of 8 letter words
* We learned about `fatalError()`. You call this when an error has a occurred that prevents your app from running. So in our case if they could not find the file in the bundle or the file was corrupt.
* So we made a function to run when the app starts by using the `.onAppear()` modifier 
* And here is how our function looks:
``` swift
func startGame() {
  if let startWordsURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "start", withExtension: "txt") {
    if let startWords = try? String(contentsOf: startWordsURL) {
      let allWords = startWords.components(separatedBy: "\n")
      rootWord = allWords.randomElement() ?? "silkworm"
      return
    }
  }
  
  fatalError("Could not load start.txt from bundle.")
}
```

### Validating words with UITextChecker
